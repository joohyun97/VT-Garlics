Good Afternoon, judges. 
We are VT-Garlics from Virginia Tech. The inspiration for GuardianTales came from the desire to help guardians stay connected with their children mentally, even though they're apart. 
In today's fast-paced world, many families face the challenge of balancing work and personal life. 
We wanted to create a platform that enables guardians to share the joy of storytelling with their kids, providing comfort and fostering a love for reading through personalized audio storybooks.
