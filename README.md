Inspiration
The inspiration for GuardianTales came from the desire to help guardians stay connected with their children mentally, even though they're apart. 
In today's fast-paced world, many families face the challenge of balancing work and personal life. 
Our team wanted to create a platform where guardians to share the joy of storytelling with their kids, 
providing comfort and fostering a love for reading through personalized audio storybooks.

What it does
GuardianTales allows guardians to create customized audio storybooks using their own voice. 
By uploading a video of themselves saying anything, our platform processes the voice and synchronizes it with the story text. 
The result is a unique, immersive, and engaging storytelling experience that children can enjoy anytime, anywhere.

We haven't had enough time to upload our ML model in cloud and the user's data, 
so the website can't currently do nothing. However, we are able to demonstrate the prototype in our local machine.

How we built it
We used streamlit frameworks in python for creating a website and machine learning model to learn the users voice and tts with the voice.

Challenges we ran into
Some of the challenges we faced included ensuring accurate voice synchronization with the story text 
and optimizing the user interface to make it intuitive and user-friendly.
